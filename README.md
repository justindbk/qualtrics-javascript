# Utilizing Javascript in Qualtrics for Survey and Experimental Designs

In this short port, I walk through several examples of how survey researchers can use Javascript to accomplish commonly needed survey tasks without advanced knowledge of the Javascript language. Much of this more complex functionality can be accomplished via Javascript embedded into the survey questions in Qualtrics, a common survey software platform.\footnote{The Qualtrics platform is an industry-standard for running online public opinion, marketing, and experimental survey research. Researchers --- in academia and elsewhere ---  rely on the platform to host their surveys usually because they are at institutions or companies that have site licenses, eliminating the cost for individual researchers to use the platform. The platform makes question layout and basic experimental designs easy to implement via a WYSIWYG user interface.}

The first of these is simply randomization: picking one option out of many options, which can be time-consuming and difficult to implement using the built-in Qualtrics randomization functionality when the potential options are very numerous. This method can be extended to accomplish \emph{n} choose \emph{p} randomization -- that is, choosing a set number of options from a larger set of many options --- which is not possible via built-in Qualtrics randomization features. Finally, I demonstrate a technique useful for survey researchers in both experimental and non-experimental settings: using a lookup table to present certain information based on a unique identifier, respondents' panel characteristics, or respondents' answers.
